I'm currently a senior principal research manager at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). 
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in 2015 and B.S. degrees in Software Engineering from Beihang University in 2010. 
I was as a visiting student in UCLA from September 2013 to September 2014. In 2015, I joined MSRA.

My research interests are in the broad areas of *systems and networking, cloud and AI infrastructure, and AI*. My recent work is mainly focusing on: 
- Artificial Specialized Intelligence
- AI for Systems and Networking
- AI for Cloud and AI Infrastructure
